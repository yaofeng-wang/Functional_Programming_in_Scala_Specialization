# Functional_Programming_in_Scala_Specialization

This repository contains the notes and solutions for the weekly assignment from my attempt of the*Functional Programming in Scala specialiation from ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FÉDÉRALE DE LAUSANNE* course on Cousera.

My solutions obtained full credits after submission, but since they are my own attempt, there may still be mistakes or flaws that were missed out by the grading system. 

If you have any suggestions on ways to improve my solution, do let me know. I would love to learn from you. Thank you :)
