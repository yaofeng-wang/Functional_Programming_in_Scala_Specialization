# Functional_Programming_in_Scala_Specialization

This repository contains the notes and solution for the weekly assignments from my attempt of *Functional Programming in Scala specialization from ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FÉDÉRALE DE LAUSANNE*, an online course from Coursera.

My solutions obtained full credits after submission, but since they are my own attempts, there may still be mistakes or flaws that were missed out by the grading system. 

If you have any suggestions on ways to improve my solution, do let me know. I would love to learn from you. Thank you :)
